The setup was very similar to Google's. It is really just a matter of taking it step by step following the documentation. We know that not all sites provide the same quality of docs but overall all Oath should be very similar. We found that the secret key was somehow added to the html which according to our instructor is not good practice. For github we had to post where google was getting and get where google was posting. Github does not provide email by default. It provides repos, followers, following and other information.
